changed all records in the cloud fair account on the created site swift.kg from proxyed to dns only so that the traffic does not go through cloud fair, but goes directly.

To transfer the swift.kg zone to cloudfair, you will need to change the ns records to cloudfair ones, do this at the Asia Info domain registrar.

Figured out how to delegate NS for a subdomain. I found out that I need to create an IN NS record and delegate it to the required dns server. I wanted to test the migration of the NS switching zone on a subdomain. Created an entry on the Taxi DNS
{code:java}
#added for testing dns migration for swift

I tried to create a site on cloudfire tst.swift.kg. Cloudfire bummer does not allow you to create a site for subdomains, you need to create an error output for second-level domains

In fact, when transferring the zone, you need to reconfigure the DNS server at the provider so that they specify ns cloudflare. It may take some time to update ns records in DNS

delegation to dnsam cloudflare.

There should be no problems with the records themselves in the zone, because the ip for the records does not change, and even if they are cached somewhere, nothing will happen.

Just in case, I reduced the ttl transferred to cloudfare by recording up to 2 minutes, deleted ns records referring to taxi dns.

I looked at the bind configs on the taxi server after the zone transfer, it will need to be removed from bind on infra2.swift.kg.
{code:java}
- Delete /etc/bind/views/interlink.conf
       include ""/etc/bind/zones/swift_interlink.conf"";- Delete /etc/bind/views/any.conf
       include ""/etc/bind/zones/swift.conf"";
- Delete configs from /etc/bind/master
     swift.kg
     swift_interlink.kg - Remove configs from /etc/bind/zones
     swift.kg
     swift_interlink.kg

named-checkconf -z
rndc reload #on both infras
{code}
Next, you need to find out the provider's contacts to change ns servers. Warn Taxi and Food to coordinate the switching time.",675831,112
75490,"I checked the imported records line by line in cloudflare in the DNS tab with the config from /etc/bind/master/swift.kg

I imported all the records, they were added to the existing ones that were automatically pulled up. I tested the import from scratch, demolished the site, re-created it without records at all.

2 - took the last back of our fat and imported only the ""NambaTaxi"" project from it

I also slipped attachments from this project into place.

During the import, I messed up a little with the fact that there are a lot of custom fields in the old fat and I had to implement them in my local instance, but the fat wizard helped with this and everything is pretty quickly googled.

3 - corrected users and went through the checklists from here - https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/jira-pre-migration-checklist-1005331549.html

4 - made sure that there is nothing superfluous

5 - took a backup from the local fat, imported it into the fat cloud

6 - in the next step, I selected the item ""Disable sending Email""

7 - the import was successful, a user from our fats associated with the project was added and the taxi project itself with 10+K tasks was added

I could not connect via ssh, the virtual machine hung. screenshot error.


To solve the problem, I did the following:

1. On both proxy servers proxy1.swift.kg and proxy2.swift.kg in the file /etc/nginx/conf.d/upstreams.conf

Commented out the upstreams associated with IP 10.7.0.151

2. Checked nginx

nginx -t

3. If everything is OK, then restart nginx on both proxies

systemctl reload nginx


Sooooo careful with the rules, until you check, do not restart nginx.

4. We are looking in the table on which physical box the virtual machine is located

https://pm.maddevs.co/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6193157

p3

5. Connect to p3

ssh 10.7.0.5

6. Check all running virtual machines

First, the overall trip can be less than 1 kilometer and less than 5 minutes, especially at night. That is, it needs to be rechecked every trip, which will fit these parameters. I think there will only be more work, but the real problem will not be eradicated.

Secondly, even if we use this feature, nothing prevents the driver from waiting 5 minutes and then completing the order on his own, or driving 1 km. Especially if they ""push through"" a loophole.

As an option, I propose to remove the driver’s access to complete the order on their own, if less than 15 minutes have passed since the order was taken and there are 50 soms on the balance. For a driver, 15 minutes is like 150 hours, and in order to complete it, he needs to call the OKC to cancel the order with a fine. And if, for example, the driver has more than 55 soms on the counter, then the trip has taken place and he can complete the order on his own. We can discuss this point in more detail when we call.",675955,1

Regarding recent info about that flow i tried to find how bifrost pulls data from Minerva and didn't find any relevant code that does that functionality.
Based on this diagram [https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/647dd881-702d-42ce-929e-02970a982317/0_0?shared=true]
i run up eros locally and tried to find a place where it send a request to create a transaction in bifrost, found multiple places. I think that this service is for marketers who creates accept Contactc3s and create orders after which there's a request being sent to Bifrost to create transactions to this endpoint /gateway/transaction_api. After creation of transaction bifrost sends request to Gambit to create an order which correlates with what we see in the diagram. After courier successfully delivers an cod_code it's being sent a request to Bifrost to update a transaction's status to successful. I consider that we should make a call with Yann and Duc, login to the dashboard of that services and figure out that endpoints. After that the flow should become clear",679031,1

in the Admin panel you could find the job by UUID. The UUID of this job is 4285b8c8-e733-494f-ad03bc8c735e815b. And the job link in the Admin Panel is [https://api.sortedhouse.com/admin/records/101?model=Job.]
it has a list of job quotes which were in different states before the job went into deadline passed state:
1) Job quotes with ids of 158, 159, 161 were in Job Pending Status - which means that the Provider has accepted the job request, but Customer hasn't shared his info with them.
2) Job Quotes with ids of 160, 163, 164 were in Expired Status - which means Exclusive time finished.
3) Job Quote with id of 162 were in the Refused Status - which means the Provider refused job request.

So when the Job itself went into Deadline passed status, all pending and expired job quotes switched their statuses to Not Chosen. The refused one is not changing its status as the Refused status is the final one.

80121,"@Vasily Toropchin

By ""visual checkbox present"" do you mean something like giving the customer an option like: ""Don't show me this provider again""?

The reason we had thought it was being implemented is because it had been brought up during intial conversations, and also in the Slack exchange below, you had told me ""As for the waiting for expiration time for the second provider, it is not implemented yet "" - so reading this, we thought it was in the process of being implemented.

On page 5 of the Sorted House outline, it is mentioned if a provider isn't selected then ""do not ask the previous provider again"" if another search is made.

This also links to another issue that has been merged into this ticket. Currently the customer is stuck if they decline the first provider and can't make another job search (they aren't asked if they want to continue searching or change their deadline - _which is something we have in place if the list of providers is exhausted - is this correct?_). They have to manually recreate the job. What will happen is they will be given the same provider they have rejected every time because that provider is the top rated one in their area for that service. This would be very frustrating and lead to complaints due to the UX.

hi [@Iain|https://sortedhouse-maddevs.slack.com/team/UM47ZDRE2], if provider is not activated he should recieved a job request.
As for the waiting for expiration time for the second provider, *it is not implemented yet.*",686460,1
80149,"[~iain], probably there is a misunderstanding. If you mean that we should show the same provider for the job is his offer was already declined, than it is in the place.
If you mean that we should show the declined provider for the other jobs of the Customer, than it is not in the system and it wasn't discussed at all.

Regarding your comment on the expiration time and late accepting by a provider, I just mean that it is not in the system (not implemented yet). And it could be implemented, however, I believe it wasn't in the initial requirements.

As for the declining the job for the Customer, yes, I agree with you it is a bit confusing for the Customer. But anyway, the system will pick that job and start searching for a another provider. And to get rid of this confusion we're making changes.",686460,1
80183,"[~iain]we've reviewed the provided documents to us, and can't find any mention of this requirements:
'On page 5 of the Sorted House outline, it is mentioned if a provider isn't selected then ""do not ask the previous provider again"" if another search is made.'

it should go under support.",686460,1
80198,"In terms of not asking the provider again if a customer chooses to decline their request, it is in the original spec in this position of the flow (if you look at the supporting UI from the original application that is referenced). However, given where we are with the project we will allow it to go into support as it doesn't stop us launching.

For the protected time period for a provider being able to accept a job, this is key to our message to providers and it is something we have had multiple conversations referencing to. We commit to providers that they should take notice when we send a job to them as they have an exclusive time period to respond. After this time they can still reply but aren't guaranteed to have their request sent to the customer (this is why we have the message stating that the providers time slot has expired). Providers will then learn to respond quickly or else lose exclusivity of the enquiry.

If they receive a notification about their exclusive period and then suddenly a message telling them that the job has been taken by somebody better than them, they will become disillusioned with our service and basically feel like they have wasted their time, and that the exclusivity period is therefore meaningless. We have been clear about this previously and don't accept that this is not fixed.",686460,1
80279,"The process behind exclusive provider time is as below:

When a customer sends out a non-urgent job request, it is sent to the highest rated provider. In the back end, by service line, we as Admin have inserted an exclusive time period for that service line, let us assume for this service it is 30 minutes.

The provider receives the job request and has 30 minutes to select Accept of Decline (or simply ignore the message) and then after 30 minutes it will be sent to the next highest rated provider. If a provider selects Decline during their exclusive period, e.g. 15 minutes in, the system would send the offer to the next highest rated provider and not wait for the remainder of the exclusive period time to expire. If no answer is given, the system will wait for the full time of the exclusive period to expire.

Let's assume the case that there are 3 providers. The 1st provider chooses Decline and the system jumps to the 2nd provider who now has their exclusive period. Provider 2 ignores the request. To be clear, the system waits for the full exclusive period of time, and then moves the job request on to provider 3. Then, provider 2 selects Accept. In this case, provider 2 has selected Accept but provider 3 is still within their exclusive time. Provider 2 receives a notification [ Your exclusive time for accepting this job expired. Do you still want to accept this job? It may still be available. ]Let's assume in this example that provider 3 ignores the job request and their exclusive period ends. The system will revert to provider 2 and not continue searching. Provider 2 gets the job and receives the appropriate notification.

Let's consider another example, again with 3 providers. Provider one chooses Decline, the system moves on to provider 2. Provider 2 ignores the request and their exclusive period expires. Provider 3 receives the request and is within their exclusive time period. Provider 2 selects Accept and receives notification (Your exclusive time for accepting this job expired. Do you still want to accept this job? It may still be available.). Now provider 3, who is still in their exclusive time period, chooses Accept. The system will give the job to provider 3, as our promise to our providers is that during their exclusive time period, if they accept the job then the enquiry is theirs. Provider 2 would receive a notification that someone else has got the job (this notification would be: Unfortunately the other provider has accepted the job request in their exclusive time slot. Thanks for accepting and we hope you are first to respond next time.)",686460,1
80403,"[~iain] thank you for giving the answers, but some more questions should be answered:
 1) Do you mean that 'Your exclusive time for accepting this job expired. Do you still want to accept this job? It may still be available.' appears when a Provider click on 'Accept Job' button?
 And if he select no, than which status the job request should be switched? Refused? Canceled?

2) If in the 2nd case provided above, the Customer doesn't share details or decline Provider 3, than we come back to the Customer that No More Providers?

3) What should happen to the expired job quote when the job is switched into deadline passed state? Expired Job Quote is not a final state. Should it be switch into Refused or Cancelled state at the side of the Provider?

4) What if everyone missed the exclusive period, but the job full wait time is not finished yet?

5) Based on the description, did I get it right, if Provider 1 missed the exclusive period and Provider 2 accept the job. After that when Provider 1 click to Accept the job, he is going to be notified that ""Unfortunately the other provider has accepted the job request in their exclusive time slot. Thanks for accepting and we hope you are first to respond next time.""
 In other words, if at least one of the next in row Providers accepted a job request, then all the Providers who are late to take the job should get this notification?
 And what state than the job quote should be switched to? Not Chosen?

6) Also, we need to somehow distinguish the late acceptance of a job request, we need a state for job quote where it would sit in unless the next provider exclusive time expires. What name do you suggest?",686460,1

As an example, we wrote what we thought was a straightforward and detailed description of how the process would work after your initial request. We then received 6 (very reasonable and logical) further questions from @Vasily asking us for further explanations. On top of this, we have no been given a visual schematic which you've asked us to refer to, which further complicates a straightforward response.

We have asked three times for a call and feel unable to progress without one. We could have had this written down and planned on Friday or Monday but that time is lost now. @Andy is traveling for work today and tomorrow so we are further down the line again.

",686460,1
80732,"*Scenario One*

Customer submits job. Provider 1 ignores. Provider 2 ignores. During provider 3 exclusive time, provider 1 accepts and is put into “waiting”. Provider 3 ignores request. The outcome is that Provider 1 is moved from “waiting” and goes into “job pending”.



*Scenario Two*

Customer submits job. Provider 1 ignores. Provider 2 ignores. During Provider 3 exclusive time Provider 1 accepts and is put into “waiting”. During Provider 3 exclusive time, Provider 3 accepts. Provider 3 is moved to “job pending”. If customer chooses to find me more providers, or declines Provider 3, Provider 1 is moved from “waiting” to “job pending”.



*Scenario Three*

Customer submits job. Provider 1 ignores. Provider 2 ignores. During Provider 3 exclusive time Provider 1 and Provider 2 both accept the job and are both moved to “waiting”. Provider 3 accepts the job and is moved to “job pending”. If customer chooses “find me more providers” or declines Provider 3, Provider 1 is moved from “waiting” to “job pending” and Provider 2 remains in “waiting” state. If customer chooses “find me more providers” or declines Provider 1 (the highest rated), Provider 2 is moved to “job pending”.



*Scenario Four*

Customer submits job. Provider 1 ignores. Provider 2 ignores. Provider 3 ignores. Let's assume there are only 3 providers. Now we are in the period “delay time before notify customer”. Provider 1 accepts and is moved into “job pending”. Provider 2 accepts and is moved to “waiting”. If customer shares details with Provider 1, Provider 2 remains in “waiting”. At the point at which deadline is reached, or job is completed, Provider 2 who is currently in “waiting”, is moved into “not chosen”.



*deadline*

In all cases where a Provider is in the “waiting” state, and deadline is reached or job is completed, then the Provider or Providers in the “waiting” state should move to “not chosen”.



*General Comments*

It should be noted that if there are multiple Providers in the “waiting” state, the highest rated is moved to “job pending” first and only one Provider is moved to “job pending” at a time. If a customer selects find me another provider, they will only ever receive one recommendation.

It should be noted that if there are providers in the “waiting” state, the highest rated is moved to “job pending” only if there is only one provider in the list and the customer chooses decline. If the customer has two or more Providers shown in their list, and they select decline on any Provider, this does not start a search and therefore will not move any Providers from “waiting” to “job pending”. This would only occur if the customer has only one provider on their list, chooses decline, which forces the system to search. The system will see there are providers in the “waiting” list and choose the highest rated.



*Provider in “waiting” state*

From the perspective of a Provider, if I am a Provider and I am in the “waiting” state and I view the job request, I will see that I am in the “waiting” state with an associated notification (“Your exclusive time for accepting this job has expired. You may still get a chance to contact the customer – we will update you""). I will have the option to cancel the job which will go to the status “cancel”.",686460,1

80763,"[~iain] hi, I'm referring to the settings of Job Quotes actions and page messages. the ones where you could set the message to be displayed at the Job Quote page in the yellow strip at the bottom. The settings which you can change in the Admin Panel under Setting/Job Action Settings.



So, basically, what message to show in waiting state? The actions are only two are available - 'Accept' and 'Refuse'.",686460,1
80785,"When a Provider is presented with a Job Quote in their exclusive time, there is a message, let's call it _Message 1_ - currently this says ""Accept enquiry? The customer will then be able to see your portfolio."" that is present in the yellow footer with the buttons ""Yes"" or ""No"".

When the job quote has expired and the Provider opens up the Job Quote, the footer shows a different message (_Message 2_ which currently reads ""Your exclusive time for accepting this job expired. Do you still want to accept this job?"") and the options still remain as ""Yes"" and ""No"". We assume the Provider clicks ""Yes"" and this then takes them into Job Waiting status.

In this status thre should be an associated message in the yellow box footer (_message 3_ which would read ""“Your exclusive time for accepting this job has expired. You may still get a chance to contact the customer – we will update you"".",686460,1

Would it be possible to have a ""pop out"" here rather than re-direct the user? It might be safer than potentially breaking the flow or refreshing the page accidentally. The text in the pop-out would be:

On a number of our services we offer customers the option of ""Urgent"" for their job deadline. This is typically for issues that need immediate attention, such as a loss of power or a leaking pipe. These are jobs often associated with terms like ""Out of Hours"" service or ""Emergency Response"". If you would like to offer your service to our customers who need a tradesperson urgently, please set the toggle button to on.

When the user went to search for a job, the system told them the address did not match. This kept happening and the user is stuck in a loop. _Is this an error with implementing the feature we discussed?_ It appears it is failing to verify that the addresses do match in this scenario.",686526,58

* Complicated and expensive logic using ably, where everything will work, but you will have to add a lot of pushes (In fact, the connecting user sends a push to check, everyone sends answers to him - 1 + number of users = expensive)
* Leave it as it is now (Ably periodically prevents one user from two devices from connecting) and trust users. Critically, if the user logs in from 2 browsers, nothing breaks except the camera (if he turns it on on both devices)
* Try to implement uniqueness logic for each device/browser (using userAgent) and look for users with a similar id. Unreliable because it's impossible to predict the user agent

Because we are modifying registration flow process, we need to consider and implement one more thing for better *GA analysis and tracking.*

We need to add final URL path for completed registration.

Currently, after the whole registration process, user gets to /teacher page (it's the homepage of the platform). That's why our Funnel report (based on URLs) is not working correctly.

So after /teacher/onboarding, i would like to suggest to design separate simple page like /teacher/onboarding/complete to identify this pageview as a completed registration.

So please accept this part for implementation.

17581,"Root causes (short):

2 transactions tries to get {{X}} lock for {{phase_commands}} table, after both got {{S}} lock for this table.

First request {{X}} lock, got it, second request right after and placed in lock queue.

First has successfully updated some rows and requests for another {{X}} lock to update some else rows. At this time second transaction will be failed with deadlock.

This situation can be handled with clone/update flow refactoring, but it will increase clone time too much.

Current fix method is to decrease deadlock possibility by wrapping whole clone flow with transaction and increase transaction attempts count. So if something will crash - nothing will be stored into the database (safe exit).



Result configuration:

Lesson clone operation → transaction with 3 attempts.
Phase clone operation → transaction with 10 attempts.
Each lesson clone operation includes phase clone operation, so

* lesson clone operation max → phases_count * 10 * 3 attempts.
* phase clone operation → 1 * 10 attempts.

Whole cloning flow (lesson or phase) fully covered with transaction, so if something goes wrong - whole operation will be canceled and we wouldn't get inconsistent data.

Tested on dev → 50 concurrency requests on phase cloning (0% errors):

easy version:

* custom media cover image - return as is (file link)
* image, based on our subjects and default variants (no color no subject, color no subject):
** there are 12 colors and relation list between _subject_ → _color_.
** we can generate physically image for each subject from the list (*51 images + 1 default ‘no color no subject’ + custom counts color*), store to the *s3* and return them as image link. Images as in teacherly → centered subject and colored background.
** this case can handle variants for - ‘No subject, not color, no image’, ‘Subject’, ‘Color, no subject’ from p. 2 feature docs
** this case can't handle 'Color, subject' - we need to generate *51 * (custom colors count)* images (required a lots of images).

*Problem*

At the front, you need to implement preview assignment and making requests to the GET {api/student-dashboard/assignments/21/lessons/56/state} point is not convenient

*Solution*

The front-enders suggested making the flow the same as in the teacher's one, but immeno:

1. Request to point GET{api/teacher/assignments/{id}}. Lesson is pulled out from here
2. Request to point GET{api/teacher/lessons/{id}/state}.
3. Request to point GET{api/teacher/sections?lesson_id={id}}

That is, on the back in the student api, you need to implement 3 identical points
